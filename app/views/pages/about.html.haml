    .card-body
      We're a small team developing this project as a part of the Netguru Code College program.
    .card-body
      The idea behind ITutor is to connect technology mentors with newbies looking for a reliable source of tech knowledge.
      The app is based on the belief that participating mentors can not stand keeping their knowledge unshared,
      and that hungry newbies are on their way to becoming mentors themselves.
    .card-body
      Initial app version implies simple connection of two groups via either internal or email messages with potential
      further connection via platform controlled meetings. The mentors have ratings and opinions.
      Any user is able to search for a mentor with a specific skill set and capable of teaching in a specific human language.
    .card-body
      ITutor runs completely on Ruby on Rails with Bootstrap and a handful other libraries sprinkled on top.
